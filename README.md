## Command Line

The most recomnended Shell is [ZSH](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/), it is the default one for Mac and is easy to install on Linux.

It is usually installed along [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) which helps managing ZSH configuration, plugins and obviously, themes! No one wants to read a sad black and white Terminal.

Personally I prefer Fish shell but it comes with the cost of not being [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) compliant.
Why would I prefer Fish shell? Because it is the outsider, is the most modern one and the syntax when writing shell scripts is just simply better.
It comes preconfigured with autocomplete, `man` parsing for flags suggestions, easy to customize interface...

For windows users you can install [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) if you want a nice terminal, there might be other options but I don't know them. Unless we're talking of using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (so it's not windows anymore ðŸ‘€)

A nice customizable prompt (and the one I use) is [Starship](https://starship.rs/)

It is recommended to use some [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) with or without starship.
Most fonts comes with ligatures, transforming an ugly >= into `>=` or === into `===`. The ligatures can be turned on or off in the VsCode settings.

## Shortcuts

Getting comfortable with your keyboard is going to help you in the long run when it comes to writing down code and dealing with the fatigue of writing.

You can check the list of availables shortcuts in VsCode by accessing the Settings.

You can as well hit `Chommand/Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the command Palette and search for Shortcuts.
